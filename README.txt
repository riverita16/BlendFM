Steps to run:
- Ensure you have all included packages installed on your machine.
- Set IP address as the program runs locally.
- Set environment variables for client-specific variables or insert into templated code (not good practice).
- When code is run, a separate browser window will open requiring you to link your Spotify account to the application. The rest of the application runs entirely in the command-line.
