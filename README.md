Simple Spotify api command-line application to create custom playlists based on user input.

**Steps to run:**
- You must have a Spotify Developer Account
- Ensure you have all included packages installed on your machine.
- Set IP address as the program runs locally.
- Set environment variables for client-specific variables or insert into templated code (not good practice).
- Run code using python/python3.
- Navigate to where the app is running on local host for authentication.
- A separate browser window will open requiring you to link your Spotify account to the application. 
- Return to command-line.
- The rest of the application runs entirely in the command-line based on user input.
